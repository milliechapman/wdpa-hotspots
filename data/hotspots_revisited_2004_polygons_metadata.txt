  Description:
    Abstract: The biodiversity hotspots are regions known to hold especially high numbers of species found nowhere else, yet their remaining habitat combined covers a little more than two percent of Earth's land surface. According to the criteria developed by Myers et al. (2000), a hotspot must meet two thresholds in order to qualify: 1) it must have at least 1500 endemic, native vascular plant species, and 2) it must have already lost at least 70% of its primary, native vegetation. In the updated analysis, Mittermeier et al. (2004) recognize 34 hotspots which together hold 50% of the world's plant species and 42% of all terrestrial vertebrates as endemics. As evidence of their urgency for global conservation, hotspots also hold exceptionally high numbers of threatened vertebrates, including 50% of threatened mammals, 73% of threatened birds and 79% of threatened amphibians as endemics. There are an estimated two billion people living in the hotspots, with 300 million people within less than 10 km of existing protected areas.
    Purpose: To show the location and extent of the 34 biodiversity hotspots (highly threatened biogeographic regions with high-biodiversity endemism), as defined by Mittermeier et al. (2004).
    Supplemental_Information: The ecoregional classification of the World Wildlife Fund-U.S. is the most widely-used bioregional classification system for global scale bioregionalization (Wikramanayake et al. 2002). In order to facilitate analysis, interoperability, and collaboration, we have gone to considerable lengths to ensure that the boundaries of hotspots correspond directly to those of the World Wildlife Fund-U.S. ecoregions (Olson et al. 2001). Thus, our calculations of hotspot extents are based on ecoregional data. In total, the hotspots incorporate 374 ecoregions, 43% of the total. The only significant exceptions to the match between hotspots and ecoregions are in three cases where recent maps update ecoregional boundaries: the Albertine Rift (Plumptre et al. 2003); Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany (van Wyk & Smith 2001); and the Caucasus (Krever et al. 2001).

Entity_and_Attribute_Information:
  Detailed_Description:
    Entity_Type:
      Entity_Type_Label: hotspots_revisited_2004_polygons
    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: FID
      Attribute_Definition: Internal feature number.
      Attribute_Definition_Source: ESRI
      Attribute_Domain_Values:
        Unrepresentable_Domain: Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.
    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: Shape
      Attribute_Definition: Feature geometry.
      Attribute_Definition_Source: ESRI
      Attribute_Domain_Values:
        Unrepresentable_Domain: Coordinates defining the features.
    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: NAME
      Attribute_Definition: Hotspot name
    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: TYPE
      Attribute_Definition: Description of the polygon type.
      Attribute_Domain_Values:
        Enumerated_Domain:
          Enumerated_Domain_Value: hotspot_area
          Enumerated_Domain_Value_Definition: Terrestrial regions that are part of a hotspot
        Enumerated_Domain:
          Enumerated_Domain_Value: outer_limit
          Enumerated_Domain_Value_Definition: Polygon that forms the limits of lines that group together islands and/or other patches of land that are part of a hotspot to form a single logical unit. The outer limit is not part of the hotspot itself but is used for display purposes and to form a grouping of regions that define the hotspot.
    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: NAME_TYPE
      Attribute_Definition: Hotspot name combined with the polygon type
    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: LEGEND
      Attribute_Definition: A field useful for making legends for display purposes. All hotspot outer limits have been given the same value so they can all be displayed with the same symbol if desired.
