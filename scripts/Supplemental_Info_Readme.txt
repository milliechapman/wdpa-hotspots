This PAD-US Version 2.0 dataset includes a variety of updates and changes from the previous version 1.4 dataset.  The following list describes updates and changes, expanding on information presented in the PAD-US 2.0 Metadata Abstract: 

1) Expanded database structure: the geodatabase feature class structure now separates fee owned lands, conservation (and other) easements, management designations overlapping fee, marine areas, proclamation boundaries and various 'Combined' feature classes (e.g. ‘Fee’ + ‘Easement’ + ‘Designation’ feature classes).  The purpose is to provide a complete and accurate (parcel based) inventory of fee ownership (with associated managing entities where applicable), without boundary gaps or overlaps.  Overlaps between agency datasets and those associated with legitimately overlapping management designations have been significantly reduced in the 'Fee' feature class of this update.  Currently, some overlaps remain as the PAD-US Team and Federal Geographic Committee (FGDC) National Boundaries Group - Federal Lands Working Group (FLWG) prioritized the completeness of the fee owned land "footprint" to include all land types over the removal of all overlaps as agencies continue to develop and align fee parcel ownership data.  For example, many 'State Wildlife Management Areas' (WMAs) overlap 'National Forests' owned in fee.  These WMAs are now available in the new 'Designation' feature class.  However, some overlaps (e.g. some 'State Parks') remain where Federal fee data are not currently available or Federal and State agencies both submitted fee data for the area.  Previous versions of PAD-US included overlapping designations (e.g. Wilderness) in the 'Fee' layer. 
 
2) Major update of the Federal estate including data from 8 agencies: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), Forest Service (USFS), Department of Defense (DOD), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  The U.S. Census Bureau also provided updated State jurisdictional boundaries, the authoritative standard to attribute 'State Name' in PAD-US.  Data from the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), Department of Energy (DOE), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) were transferred from PAD-US 1.4 as best available data.  The Federal update was developed in close collaboration with the FLWG (https://communities.geoplatform.gov/ngda-govunits/federal-lands-workgroup/).  Federal lands data include those administered under fee title (e.g. 'National Forest', 'National Park', 'National Wildlife Refuge'), congressional designations (e.g. 'Wilderness Area', 'Wild and Scenic River'), Presidential proclamations (e.g. 'National Monument'), administrative protected areas (e.g. BLM 'Area of Critical Environmental Concern', USFS 'Research Natural Area') and conservation easements.  The new 'Proclamation' feature class includes boundaries that provide additional context for the 'Fee', 'Designation', or 'Easement' feature classes, suitable for display as an outline because internal ownership is not represented.  These include Military Lands, Proclamation (National Park Service and Forest Service), or Approved Acquisition Boundaries (Fish and Wildlife Service). Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) American Indian and Alaskan Native Lands are not included in PAD-US 2.0.  

3) Major updates in 30 States, plus limited additions in 16 other States following the integration of nonprofit partner databases as described below.  The PAD-US State data-steward Network provided 12 State updates (including State, local government and (or) privately protected fee lands only) in California, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.  States and Territories without updates were transferred from PAD-US 1.4.  Information regarding State stewards is available at https://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/partners/.   

4) The Nature Conservancy's (TNC) Secured Lands 2015 Public Database (http://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/edc/reportsdata/terrestrial/secured/Pages/default.aspx) completely replaced non-Federal data in an additional 9 States and the District of Columbia across the eastern seaboard including States without PAD-US updates since 2014 or where no active State steward is available for Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  In addition, new protected areas were added to help complete the inventory in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.  Please note differences in standards exist.  The Nature Conservancy integrates overlapping designations directly into fee ownership.  Efforts to improve alignment with PAD-US are in progress.  

5) Ducks Unlimited (DU, https://www.ducks.org) integrated Conservation and Recreation Lands (CARL) data (non-Federal only) in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.  DU will no longer maintain CARL and will submit updates directly to USGS for future PAD-US updates.  

6) The Trust for Public Land's (TPL) Conservation Almanac (https://www.conservationalmanac.org) database added protected areas (non-Federal) to PAD-US in 46 States including Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Montana, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, and South Carolina that had more than 50 new additions.  Please note that agency source data are not reflected in PAD-US 'Local' fields.  'Local Designation Type' includes National Conservation Easement Database (NCED) descriptions while 'Local Unit Name', 'Local Manager' and 'Local Owner' reflect public spending information collected for the Conservation Almanac. Spending attributes do not always reflect the original spatial data provided by managing agencies.  Efforts to improve alignment with PAD-US are in progress.  

7) The Nature Conservancy Lands (TNC, https://www.tnclands.tnc.org/) database update: the national source of lands owned in fee or managed by TNC.  Please note that TNC shared easements with the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED) team for integration prior to the NCED delivery for PAD-US. 

8) Complete National Conservation Easement Database update (NCED, https://www.conservationeasement.us): Integration of non-sensitive easements (suitable for publication in the public domain) from NCED, provided by NCED Partners Ducks Unlimited and the Trust for Public Land.  Federal easements are compiled by USGS in cooperation with the FLWG and shared with Ducks Unlimited for NCED integration. 

9) Complete National Marine Protected Areas (MPA) update: from the NOAA MPA Inventory (https://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov).  This update includes significant changes to GAP Status Code and IUCN Category following NOAA’s conservation measures review. 

10) First integration of Bureau of Energy Ocean Management (BOEM, https://www.boem.gov/) managed marine lands: BOEM submitted Outer Continental Shelf Area lands managed for natural resources (minerals, oil and gas), a significant and new addition to PAD-US.  

11) Fee boundary overlap assessment: topology overlaps in the PAD-US 2.0 'Fee' feature class have been identified and are available for user and data-steward reference.  Users are encouraged to overview these overlaps prior to analyses involving fee lands data by reviewing the PAD-US 2.0 Topology Overlap Assessment referenced in the Logical_Consistency_Report Section of PAD-US 2.0 metadata.  The assessment identifies all overlaps (minimum distance between feature coordinates to evaluate overlap relationship = 0.05 meter), large (greater than 5 acres) and small (less than 5 acres) overlaps between Federal agency lands and between Federal and State agency lands data in the Fee feature class.  

The following list summarizes minor changes in PAD-US 2.0: 

1) Conservation measures review: the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service (USFS) reviewed and approved the classification system USGS follows to assign 'GAP Status Code' and 'IUCN Category' to units in PAD-US (by Designation Type and size).  For more information see the PAD-US Data Manual Document, https://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/manual/.  

2) New "Date of Establishment" (DOE) records to track the year an area was designated or otherwise protected, provided by PAD-US State data-stewards and Federal partners.  This field is not fully attributed and remaining data gaps are resource intensive to identify and compile. 

3) Many 'Public Access' assignments have been reviewed by select PAD-US State data-stewards, Federal and nonprofit partners.  'Public Access' (i.e. 'Open', 'Closed', 'Restricted', 'Unknown') generally describes recreation access to protected areas as defined by data-stewards and partners for specific units or categorical assignments by 'Designation Type' (See PAD-US Data Manual Document, https://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/manual/).  Locally reviewed or assigned 'Public Access' measures were transferred from PAD-US version 1.4.  This includes those without 'GAP - Default' listed as the source reference, indicating categorical assignments by 'Designation Type' when other information is not available (See 'Public Access Source' field in the PAD-US database for references to organizations providing review and 'Public Access Source Date' for the year of assignment or review).  

4) Removed minor boundary inconsistencies: The PAD-US Team deleted small (or sliver) boundary discrepancies associated with State and local government lands falling outside U.S. Census Bureau State jurisdictional boundaries (slivers associated with Federal, regional or nonprofit provided data remain as source data has not been altered).  

5) Revised 'Aggregator Source' references: to describe the Aggregator (Organization), version of PAD-US when the update occurred, reference to the original source data file, and a State reference to manage agency boundaries falling outside U.S. Census Bureau State jurisdictional boundaries (for State data-steward submissions only).  

6) Expanded 'Category' field domain to identify new data types: includes 'Fee', 'Easement', 'Other' (leases, agreements), 'Unknown', 'Designation', 'Marine Area', and 'Approved, Proclamation or Extent Boundary'.  

7) Added various 'Combined' feature classes to the geodatabase: previous versions of PAD-US only included one 'Combined' file created by aggregating all feature classes in the geodatabase.  PAD-US 2.0 offers several combinations such as a) 'Proclamation' + 'Marine' + 'Fee' + 'Designation' + 'Easement' feature classes, b) 'Marine' + 'Fee' + 'Designation' + 'Easement' feature classes, and c) 'Fee' + 'Designation' + 'Easement' feature classes.  

8) Added a new 'Feature Class' field: PAD-US 2.0 includes a new field in the 'Combined' feature classes of the geodatabase to identify the original feature class a unit originated from before combination.
